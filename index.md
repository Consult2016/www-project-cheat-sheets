## Our Goal

The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series was created to provide a concise collection of high value information on specific application security topics. These cheat sheets were created by various application security professionals who have expertise in specific topics. We hope that the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series provides you with excellent security guidance in an easy to read format.

If you have any questions about the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series, please email the project leader [Jim Manico](mailto:jim.manico@owasp.org), contact us on the project's Slack channel, or on our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cheat-sheets-project) (**Slack is highly preferred over the Google Group**).

The archives of the old mailing list can be consulted [here](https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-cheat-sheets/index).

## Official Website

The official website on which all the cheat sheets are hosted is at <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org>.

## Migration GitHub

Project has been fully migrated to [GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries).

This page is used as the OWASP homepage of the project, all the project's content is hosted on the [CSS GitHub repository](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries) and we work **only from** this repository, **the wiki is not used anymore**.

The [CSS GitHub repository](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries) is used for the work on the cheat sheets, and the released ones are deployed on the [official website](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org).

So, from now, only a GitHub account is needed to contribute :)
